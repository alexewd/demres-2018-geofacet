  abstract = {Background: The Lexis surface plot is an established visualization tool in demography. Its present
utility, however, is limited to the domain of one-dimensional magnitudes such as rates
and counts. Visualizing proportions among three or more groups on a period-age grid is
an unsolved problem.

Objective: We seek to extend the Lexis surface plot to the domain of compositional data.

Methods: We propose four techniques for visualizing group compositions on a period-age grid. To
demonstrate the techniques we use data on age-speciﬁc cause-of-death compositions in
France from 1925 to 1999. We compare the visualizations for compliance with multiple
desired criteria.

Results: Compositional data can effectively be visualized on the Lexis surface. A key feature of
the classical Lexis surface plot – to show age, period, and cohort patterns – is retained
in the domain of compositions. The optimal choice among the four proposed techniques
depends primarily on the number of groups making up the composition and whether or
not the plot should be readable by people with impaired colour vision.

Contribution: We introduce techniques for visualizing compositional data on a period-age grid to the
ﬁeld of demography and demonstrate the usefulness of the techniques by performing
an exploratory analysis of age-speciﬁc French cause-of-death patterns across the 20th
century. We identify strengths and weaknesses of the four proposed techniques. We contribute a technique to construct the ternary-balance colour scheme from within a per-
ceptually uniform colour space.

Comments: A full-colour representation is key to understanding the paper. Therefore, we recommend that you read it on screen or print a colour version.},

  abstract = {Life expectancy in Mexico increased for more than six decades but then stagnated in the period 2000–10. This decade was characterized by the enactment of a major health care reform—the implementation of the Seguro Popular de Salud (Popular Health Insurance), which was intended to provide coverage to the entire Mexican population—and by an unexpected increase in homicide mortality. We assessed the impact on life expectancy of conditions amenable to medical service—those sensitive to public health policies and changes in behaviors, homicide, and diabetes—by analyzing mortality trends at the state level. We found that life expectancy among males deteriorated from 2005 to 2010, compared to increases from 2000 to 2005. Females in most states experienced small gains in life expectancy between 2000 and 2010. The unprecedented rise in homicides after 2005 led to a reversal in life expectancy increases among males and a slowdown among females in most states in the first decade of the twenty-first century.},

  abstract = {This book visualizes mortality dynamics in the Lexis diagram. While the standard approach of plotting death rates is also covered, the focus in this book is on the depiction of rates of mortality improvement over age and time. This rather novel approach offers a more intuitive understanding of the underlying dynamics, enabling readers to better understand whether period- or cohort-effects were instrumental for the development of mortality in a particular country. Besides maps for single countries, the book includes maps on the dynamics of selected causes of death in the United States, such as cardiovascular diseases or lung cancer. The book also features maps for age-specific contributions to the change in life expectancy, for cancer survival and for seasonality in mortality for selected causes of death in the United States. The book is accompanied by instructions on how to use the freely available R Software to produce these types of surface maps. Readers are encouraged to use the presented tools to visualize other demographic data or any event that can be measured by age and calendar time, allowing them to adapt the methods to their respective research interests. The intended audience is anyone who is interested in visualizing data by age and calendar time; no specialist knowledge is required.This book is open access under a CC BY license.},
