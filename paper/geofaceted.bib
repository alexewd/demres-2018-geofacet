  volume = {36},
  doi = {10.4054/DemRes.2017.36.21},
  abstract = {Background: The Lexis surface plot is an established visualization tool in demography. Its present
utility, however, is limited to the domain of one-dimensional magnitudes such as rates
and counts. Visualizing proportions among three or more groups on a period-age grid is
an unsolved problem.

Objective: We seek to extend the Lexis surface plot to the domain of compositional data.

Methods: We propose four techniques for visualizing group compositions on a period-age grid. To
demonstrate the techniques we use data on age-specific cause-of-death compositions in
France from 1925 to 1999. We compare the visualizations for compliance with multiple
desired criteria.

Results: Compositional data can effectively be visualized on the Lexis surface. A key feature of
the classical Lexis surface plot \textendash{} to show age, period, and cohort patterns \textendash{} is retained
in the domain of compositions. The optimal choice among the four proposed techniques
depends primarily on the number of groups making up the composition and whether or
not the plot should be readable by people with impaired colour vision.

Contribution: We introduce techniques for visualizing compositional data on a period-age grid to the
field of demography and demonstrate the usefulness of the techniques by performing
an exploratory analysis of age-specific French cause-of-death patterns across the 20th
century. We identify strengths and weaknesses of the four proposed techniques. We contribute a technique to construct the ternary-balance colour scheme from within a per-
ceptually uniform colour space.

Comments: A full-colour representation is key to understanding the paper. Therefore, we recommend that you read it on screen or print a colour version.},

  abstract = {This book visualizes mortality dynamics in the Lexis diagram. While the standard approach of plotting death rates is also covered, the focus in this book is on the depiction of rates of mortality improvement over age and time. This rather novel approach offers a more intuitive understanding of the underlying dynamics, enabling readers to better understand whether period- or cohort-effects were instrumental for the development of mortality in a particular country. Besides maps for single countries, the book includes maps on the dynamics of selected causes of death in the United States, such as cardiovascular diseases or lung cancer. The book also features maps for age-specific contributions to the change in life expectancy, for cancer survival and for seasonality in mortality for selected causes of death in the United States. The book is accompanied by instructions on how to use the freely available R Software to produce these types of surface maps. Readers are encouraged to use the presented tools to visualize other demographic data or any event that can be measured by age and calendar time, allowing them to adapt the methods to their respective research interests. The intended audience is anyone who is interested in visualizing data by age and calendar time; no specialist knowledge is required.This book is open access under a CC BY license.},

  abstract = {Objectives. To quantify the effect of the upsurge of violence on life expectancy and life span inequality in Mexico after 2005.Methods. We calculated age- and cause-specific contributions to changes in life expectancy and life span inequality conditional on surviving to age 15 years between 1995 and 2015. We analyzed homicides, medically amenable conditions, diabetes, ischemic heart diseases, and traffic accidents by state and sex.Results. Male life expectancy at age 15 years increased by more than twice in 1995 to 2005 (1.17 years) than in 2005 to 2015 (0.55 years). Life span inequality decreased by more than half a year for males in 1995 to 2005, whereas in 2005 to 2015 the reduction was about 4 times smaller. Homicides for those aged between 15 and 49 years had the largest effect in slowing down male life expectancy and life span inequality. Between 2005 and 2015, three states in the north experienced life expectancy losses while 5 states experienced increased life span inequality.Conclusions. Ten years into the upsurge of violence, Mexico has not been able to reduce the homicide levels to those before 2005. Life expectancy and life span inequality stagnated since 2005 for young men at the national level. In some states, males live shorter lives than in 2005, on average, and experience higher uncertainty in their eventual death. (Am J Public Health.
